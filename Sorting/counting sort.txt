used if all the items are keys and there is no associated values

we won't need any queues

just count copies of each key

just like bucket sort, this doesn't allow many possible keys i.e. the no of different keys is small

takes O(q+n) time where : q= number of different possible keys
n = number of items we r sorting
and if q is within small range i.e. q belongs to O(n) then this takes linear time O(n)

array : counting sort takes less memory
link list : bucket sort is more natural than counting sort
