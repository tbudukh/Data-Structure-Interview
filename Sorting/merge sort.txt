Good for link lists but not so for arrays

you can merge 2 sorted lists into 1 sorted list in linear time

let Q1 and Q2 are 2 sorted queues

let Q be the empty queue
while(neither of Q1 and Q2 is empty){
item1=Q1.front();
item2=Q2.front();
move smaller item from these 2 into the end of Q.
}

concat remaining non empty queue (Q1 or Q2) to the end of Q.


mergesort is a recursive divide and conquer algorithm.


mergesort :
-------------------
start with unsorted list I of n items
break I into I1 and I2 each with n/2 items
sort I1 recursively giving S1
sort I2 recursively giving S2
merge S1 and S2 into a sorted list S.



it is not an inplace sort. hence its not good for arrays. for arrays it takes double the space of array.
