Always runs in O(N^2) time.

we have sorted list S and we have unsorted list I.

for(i=0;i<n;i++){
X= item in I with smallest key				// this step takes O(N) time
remove x from I and append to S.
}


whether S is array or link list, this takes O(N^2) even in best case. This can also be done in-place
